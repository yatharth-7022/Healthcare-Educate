Context: The SmashMed platform already has:
* Landing pages
* About pages and related pages
* Pricing page
* Authentication (Login / Register)
Now create a post-login user dashboard that users are navigated to immediately after logging in.
You have full access to the existing SmashMed codebase, design system, components, and styles.
⚠️ Do not introduce a new theme. ⚠️ Do not redesign existing brand elements. The dashboard must feel like a natural continuation of the platform.

Dashboard Goal
Create a beautiful, professional, non-generic dashboard that feels:
* Calm
* Academic
* Premium
* Purposeful (not cluttered)
This dashboard is for serious GAMSAT students, not a casual learning app.

Core Requirements (MANDATORY)
1️⃣ Welcome Section
At the top of the dashboard:
* Greet the user personally:
    * “Welcome back, {UserName}”
* Secondary line:
    * A calm motivational or contextual line (e.g. “Your GAMSAT preparation, all in one place.”)
* Pull the user’s name from authenticated user data

2️⃣ Primary Course Card (CRITICAL)
Since there is currently only one course, display a prominent course card for:
GAMSAT Preparation Course
The card should include:
* Course title
* Short description
* Progress indicator (even if placeholder)
* Primary CTA:
    * “Go to course” / “Continue learning”
* Secondary CTA (optional):
    * “View syllabus” or “View schedule”
This card should be:
* Visually dominant
* Clean
* Confident
* Not oversized or flashy

Additional Dashboard Content (DESIGN FREEDOM — IMPORTANT)
You are encouraged to add additional sections that make sense for a professional education dashboard, such as:
* Progress overview
* Upcoming live classes
* Recent activity
* Study reminders
* Performance snapshots
* Quick links to key resources
⚠️ These should feel intentional and helpful, not filler.
Avoid:
* Social-media style feeds
* Gamification
* Overloaded widgets

Navigation & Layout
* Use a clean dashboard layout:
    * Top navigation or side navigation (your choice)
* Clear visual hierarchy
* Plenty of whitespace
* Subtle section separation

Dark / Light Mode (MANDATORY)
Theme Toggle
* Add a Light / Dark mode toggle in the top-right corner
* Place it near:
    * Profile avatar
    * Account menu
* Toggle must:
    * Persist user preference
    * Affect entire dashboard
    * Respect SmashMed color palette in both modes
Dark mode should be:
* Deep, muted
* Easy on the eyes
* Professional (not pure black)

Profile Menu (Top Right)
* Profile avatar icon
* Dropdown menu:
    * Account
    * Settings
    * Log out
* Theme toggle accessible here

Visual & UX Guidelines
* Match SmashMed typography, spacing, and colors
* Use subtle animations:
    * Fade-in
    * Small translate on load
* No heavy animation libraries
* Smooth interactions only

Technical Constraints
* Next.js (App Router)
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* Component-based structure
* Reusable dashboard cards
* Accessible (keyboard + screen readers)

Design Freedom Clause (IMPORTANT)
You are encouraged to design this dashboard thoughtfully and creatively, within professional boundaries. Avoid generic admin dashboards. This should feel purpose-built for medical education.

FINAL INSTRUCTION (CRITICAL)
Render a fully implemented, visually rich dashboard. Do not describe it. Include welcome messaging, the GAMSAT course card, useful supporting sections, and a working light/dark mode toggle.
