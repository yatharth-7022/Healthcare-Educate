Context:
You are working inside an existing production web application called Healthcare Educative.
The application already has a defined theme, color palette, typography, layout system, animations, and navbar.
You must strictly reuse the existing theme and styles — do not introduce new colors, fonts, or design systems.

🎯 Objective

Create a professional, elegant, and visually stunning Honour Roll page for Healthcare Educative and integrate it seamlessly into the app.

🧭 Navigation Update

Add a new navbar item labeled “Honour Roll”

The navbar item should:

Match existing navbar styling and animations

Respect hover states, active states, and responsiveness

On click, route the user to /honour-roll (or follow the app’s existing routing conventions)

🏆 Honour Roll Page — Design & UX Requirements

Design this page as a premium academic recognition page, similar to what top universities or medical institutions would publish.

Overall Feel

Clean, professional, and prestigious

Emotion: achievement, pride, excellence

Modern UI with subtle but smooth animations

Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)

🎨 Visual Design Guidelines

Reuse existing colors, gradients, typography, spacing, and shadows

No hard-coded colors — pull from the app’s theme

Maintain visual consistency with:

Pricing page

About page

Landing sections

✨ Page Structure (Suggested – you may improve)
1. Hero Section

Large heading: “Honour Roll”

Subheading explaining recognition, e.g.
“Celebrating the outstanding achievements of our Medicine & Dentistry students”

Soft background gradient or pattern consistent with app

Entrance animation (fade-in + slight upward motion)

2. Honour Roll Content Section

Display the following exact data, formatted professionally (cards, list, timeline, or grid — your choice):

Smooth transitions only (no aggressive motion)

Use the same animation libraries or patterns already in the app

⚙️ Technical Requirements

Follow existing:

Component patterns

Routing system

Folder structure

Styling conventions (Tailwind / CSS modules / etc.)

Code should be:

Clean

Reusable

Maintainable

Do NOT break or modify existing pages
