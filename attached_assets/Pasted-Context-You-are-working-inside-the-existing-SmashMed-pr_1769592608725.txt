Context:
You are working inside the existing SmashMed project.
You have full access to the current codebase, components, styles, animations, and layout system.

Create a Live Courses page that visually and technically matches the rest of the SmashMed platform.
Do not introduce a new theme.
Reuse existing patterns, spacing, typography, and animations.

Page Purpose

Create a clean, professional, and content-rich Live Courses page that explains SmashMed’s three live course offerings clearly on a single page.

This page should feel:

Structured

Academic

Premium

Confident

Easy to navigate despite heavy content

Page Structure (IMPORTANT)

Display all three live course sections on one page

Use a modern UI pattern such as:

Tabs

Segmented navigation

Accordion-style sections

Or another clean, professional interaction

The navigation between sections must be clear and intuitive

Smooth transitions / subtle animations (matching existing pages)

Extra Content (IMPORTANT — ADD YOURSELF)

To ensure the page feels full and premium, add:

Brief comparison summaries between S1 / S2 / S3

Small highlight cards (e.g. “Small group learning”, “Live feedback”, “ACER-aligned”)

A short FAQ-style section (2–3 questions)

Subtle dividers and spacing to improve readability

Do not add fluff — keep everything academically relevant.

Design & UX Constraints

Match existing SmashMed theme exactly

Reuse animations already present in the project

Clean spacing and hierarchy

No bright colors or playful elements

No heavy animation libraries

Smooth section transitions only

Fully responsive

Production-ready UI

Technical Constraints

Next.js (App Router)

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

Component-based structure

Reusable sections

Accessible interactions

Final Instruction (CRITICAL)

Render this as a fully implemented Live Courses page, not a description.
All three sections must exist on one page.
Use a modern, professional UI pattern to organise them.
Add supportive content where appropriate to make the page feel complete.
