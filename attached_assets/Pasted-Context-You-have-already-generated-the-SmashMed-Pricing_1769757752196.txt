Context:
You have already generated the SmashMed Pricing page.
Now add one additional section directly BELOW the pricing cards and ABOVE any other sections.

Do not modify the pricing cards themselves.

Section Purpose (IMPORTANT)

Add a moving, animated student reviews section that:

Builds trust immediately after pricing

Reinforces value before the user scrolls further

Matches the exact interaction style of Medify’s pricing page

This section is conversion-critical.

Section Placement (DO NOT CHANGE)

📍 Place this section:

Immediately below the pricing cards

Before any large testimonials or footer sections

Layout & Structure (MATCH MEDIFY EXACTLY)
Heading (Centered)

SmashMed is trusted by GAMSAT students across Australia

Same hierarchy as Medify

Calm, professional typography

No over-decoration

Animated Reviews Row (CRITICAL)

Render a horizontal, continuously moving carousel of student review cards that:

Auto-scroll left → right

Infinite loop

Smooth, slow movement

Pauses on hover

Is NOT user-draggable (auto motion first)

This must feel subtle, premium, and calm — not flashy.

Review Card Design (MATCH IMAGE)

Each card must include:

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5-star rating)

Short 1–2 line testimonial

Student name

Result / achievement (small text)

Card Styling Rules

White background

Rounded corners

Soft shadow

Equal card sizes

Plenty of padding

No gradients

No borders

Match SmashMed colors & fonts

Example Review Content (You may generate realistic placeholders)

Use short, realistic lines like:

“SmashMed helped me feel confident walking into the GAMSAT.”

“The structure and explanations made a huge difference.”

“I finally understood how to approach difficult passages.”

“Clear strategies, high-quality resources, and great support.”

⚠️ These are short trust signals, not long testimonials.

Animation Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)

Use CSS-based animation

No heavy animation libraries

No scroll-jacking

Smooth linear motion

Consistent speed

Seamless loop (no jump at reset)

Responsiveness

Desktop: multiple cards visible, moving horizontally

Tablet: fewer cards visible

Mobile: cards still animate but slower and larger

No horizontal scrollbar visible

Tech Stack (USE EXISTING)

Next.js (App Router)

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

Reusable testimonial card component

Accessible markup

Visual Consistency Rules

Must match SmashMed’s existing theme

Reuse spacing, shadows, and typography

Same animation style as other SmashMed sections

This section should feel native, not added later

FINAL INSTRUCTION (DO NOT IGNORE)

This section must be visually rendered and animated, not described.
It must scroll automatically left to right like the Medify pricing page.
Do not replace existing testimonials elsewhere.

⚠️ If Lovable skips animation, paste this line after:

Use an auto-scrolling, infinite horizontal animation — do not render this as a static grid.
