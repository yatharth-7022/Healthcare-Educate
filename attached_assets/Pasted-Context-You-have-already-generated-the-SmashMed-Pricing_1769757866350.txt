Context: You have already generated the SmashMed Pricing page. Now add one additional section below the content
Do not modify the pricing cards themselves.

Section Purpose (IMPORTANT)
Add a moving, animated student reviews section that:
* Builds trust immediately after pricing
* Reinforces value before the user scrolls further
* Matches the exact interaction style of Medify’s pricing page
This section is conversion-critical.

Section Placement (DO NOT CHANGE)
📍 Place this section:
* Before any large testimonials or footer sections

Layout & Structure (MATCH MEDIFY EXACTLY)
Heading (Centered)
SmashMed is trusted by GAMSAT students across Australia
* Same hierarchy as Medify
* Calm, professional typography
* No over-decoration

Animated Reviews Row (CRITICAL)
Render a horizontal, continuously moving carousel of student review cards that:
* Auto-scroll left → right
* Infinite loop
* Smooth, slow movement
* Pauses on hover
* Is NOT user-draggable (auto motion first)
This must feel subtle, premium, and calm — not flashy.

Review Card Design (MATCH IMAGE)
Each card must include:
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5-star rating)
* Short 1–2 line testimonial
* Student name
* Result / achievement (small text)
Card Styling Rules
* White background
* Rounded corners
* Soft shadow
* Equal card sizes
* Plenty of padding
* No gradients
* No borders
* Match SmashMed colors & fonts

Example Review Content (You may generate realistic placeholders)
Use short, realistic lines like:
* “SmashMed helped me feel confident walking into the GAMSAT.”
* “The structure and explanations made a huge difference.”
* “I finally understood how to approach difficult passages.”
* “Clear strategies, high-quality resources, and great support.”
⚠️ These are short trust signals, not long testimonials. You already have the images of students as they are getting used in the landing page so use those images for images of students

Animation Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)
* Use CSS-based animation
* No heavy animation libraries
* No scroll-jacking
* Smooth linear motion
* Consistent speed
* Seamless loop (no jump at reset)

Responsiveness
* Desktop: multiple cards visible, moving horizontally
* Tablet: fewer cards visible
* Mobile: cards still animate but slower and larger
* No horizontal scrollbar visible


Visual Consistency Rules
* Must match SmashMed’s existing theme
* Reuse spacing, shadows, and typography
* Same animation style as other SmashMed sections
* This section should feel native, not added later

FINAL INSTRUCTION (DO NOT IGNORE)
This section must be visually rendered and animated, not described. It must scroll automatically left to right like the Medify pricing page. Do not replace existing testimonials elsewhere.

Use an auto-scrolling, infinite horizontal animation — do not render this as a static grid.
