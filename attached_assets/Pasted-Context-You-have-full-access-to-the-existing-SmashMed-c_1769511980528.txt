Context:
You have full access to the existing SmashMed codebase, components, styles, and design system.
Now create an About Us page that matches the current project visually, structurally, and technically.

Do not introduce a new theme.
Do not redesign existing patterns.
Reuse spacing, typography, colors, and layout logic already present in the app.

Page Purpose

Create a professional, credible, and personable About Us page for a GAMSAT tutoring platform.

This page should:

Explain why SmashMed exists

Clearly articulate what makes SmashMed different

Build trust and authority

Feel human, academic, and confident (not salesy)

This should look like what a serious education company’s About page looks like.

Content to Display (Render as Real Sections)
Core Statement

Display the following message prominently:

Getting you into med.

Followed by:

How? By offering the highest quality tutoring AND resources.

The Problem With Existing Tutoring Models

Explain clearly that there are two common tutoring approaches:

Companies with a large number of resources, but:

Low quality

Little to no individualized support

Individual tutors with:

High levels of personal support

Poor quantity and scalability of resources

SmashMed’s Solution

Render this explanation clearly and confidently:

SmashMed bridges this gap.
We are the first tutoring company for GAMSAT to offer highly individualised tutoring in small groups, while also providing the highest quality resources available — including 80+ sample essays for Section 2, Section 3 concepts that actually come up, and Section 1 strategies to tackle even the most obscure passages.

“About Me” Section
About Me :)

Include a creator image (asset provided)

Present this section as:

Personal

Credible

Approachable

Should feel like a founder introduction, not a résumé dump

Teaching Philosophy Sections (Image + Text Pairs)

Using the provided images, create multiple image + explanatory text sections that explain SmashMed’s teaching approach.

Section 1 (S1 – Reasoning)

Section 2 (S2 – Writing)

Display this text:

Learn EXACTLY what you need to write to score an 80+. You’ll receive my own 80+ scoring sample essays and refined contentions so that you can consistently stand out from the rest of the cohort.
