Project: Professional healthcare education platform landing page
Brand: SmashMed
Audience: Graduate-entry medicine aspirants (GAMSAT), Australia-focused
Reference layout: Medify.co (match layout structure, spacing, hierarchy — not branding)

Overall Design Direction

Create a clean, minimal, premium SaaS landing page for a healthcare education platform.
The platform must feel:

Trustworthy

Academically serious

Calm and confident

Professional (not playful, not flashy)

Avoid loud colors, heavy gradients, or trendy animations.
Use generous whitespace, strong typography hierarchy, and subtle visual details

Sticky top navigation

White background

Left: SmashMed logo (provided)

Center / left navigation with dropdown menus (same interaction and visual style as Medify):

GAMSAT

Live Courses

Pricing

UI & UX Rules (Important)

Desktop-first, fully responsive

Everything should feel production-ready

Brand Consistency

Respect SmashMed logo colors

Do not introduce new bold brand colors

Overall tone: calm, serious, aspirational

Final Instruction to Level

Match the layout, spacing, and structure of Medify’s landing page very closely, but keep all branding, content, and visuals unique to SmashMed. The result should look like a real, investor-ready healthcare education platform.
