You have already generated the SmashMed landing page  Now add a dedicated authentication page that matches the same design system, typography, and professionalism.
Do not redesign the brand. Do not change existing components.

1️⃣ Page Purpose & Tone
Create a professional, calm, healthcare-grade authentication page for a medical education platform.
The page must feel:
* Trustworthy
* Minimal
* Academic
* Premium (not startup-flashy)
This is a serious platform for future doctors.

2️⃣ Page Layout (MANDATORY)
Structure
* Full viewport height
* Two-column layout on desktop
* Single-column on mobile

Left Column (Visual / Branding)
* Background color: warm ivory #FAF8F4
* Subtle topographic / contour line pattern
    * Lavender #B4A7D6
    * Very low opacity (2–4%)
* SmashMed logo at top
* Short brand statement centered vertically:
Prepare with clarity. Perform with confidence.
* Typography consistent with landing page

Right Column (Auth Form)
* White background
* Centered card/container
* Soft shadow
* Rounded corners
* Max width ~420–460px

3️⃣ Authentication Modes (DO NOT SKIP)
Tabs at Top of Card
* Login
* Create account
Tabs must be:
* Clearly visible
* Keyboard accessible
* Smooth underline or highlight transition
* No page reload when switching (client-side state)

4️⃣ Login Form (MANDATORY)
Fields
* Email address
* Password
Actions
* Primary button: Log in
* Secondary text link: Forgot password?

5️⃣ Register Form (MANDATORY)
Fields
* Full name
* Email address
* Password
* Confirm password
Actions
* Primary button: Create account

6️⃣ Form Design Rules
* Use labels (not placeholders only)
* Clear error states (red but subtle)
* Accessible focus states
* No unnecessary fields
* Calm spacing (not cramped)

7️⃣ Typography & Colors (MATCH LANDING PAGE)
* Headings: Source Sans 3
* Body & labels: IBM Plex Sans
* Primary accent: #674EA7
* Text secondary: #5C6770

8️⃣ Tech Stack (USE EXACTLY)
* Next.js (App Router)
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* Controlled form components
* No external UI libraries
* No inline styles

9️⃣ UX & Accessibility (IMPORTANT)
* Keyboard navigable
* Proper form semantics
* Accessible error messages
* Responsive on all screen sizes

🔚 Final Instruction (CRITICAL)
This page must be fully rendered visually, not described. Include both Login and Register states. Match SmashMed’s existing design system exactly. Output production-ready code.
